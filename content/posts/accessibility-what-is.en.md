# **Accessibility**

**When we think about accessibility, there are many starting points.**  

We can explore specific needs, identify existing assistive technologies, learn the correct terminologies... With so many entry points, I decided to start today with the term *A11y*, which I find very friendly and interesting. üòä  

‚ÄúA11y‚Äù is an abbreviation for the term *accessibility*, with the number 11 representing the 11 letters between the first and last letters of the word. It‚Äôs used to describe the capacity of products, services, technologies, and places to be accessible and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. Accessibility involves removing physical, sensory, and cognitive barriers to allow people with disabilities to fully participate in society, ensuring everyone can access information and services effectively and efficiently. Accessibility is fundamental to fostering inclusion and ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all.  

This abbreviation originated in the English language, where the word *ally* means "ally." That makes it a great starting point for exploring accessibility, as it reflects the idea of support and partnership. It‚Äôs widely used in many contexts to signify a focus on accessibility.

Now, looking at the **web development universe**, which is where I live, I believe accessibility should be a critical factor when creating any new implementation. However, since this topic isn‚Äôt always a priority when learning to code, I want to introduce accessibility concepts from the very beginning.  

**Web accessibility** is essential because it ensures that people‚Äîregardless of their physical, sensory, or cognitive abilities‚Äîcan access and interact with online content. Beyond that, accessible web content built according to accessibility guidelines ensures compatibility with existing assistive technologies. It's hard to think about diversity and inclusion without keeping this in mind. Accessible web content makes the internet truly available to individuals with disabilities or specific needs.  

By creating websites and applications that are accessible, developers ensure that everyone can access information, services, and online resources. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world where many essential services and information are offered exclusively online.

The foundation of web accessibility lies in following the guidelines set by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** through the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**. The first version of this document was published in 1999, with updates in 2008. This guide is indispensable for building accessible websites.  

While the WCAG primarily targets programmers, it also provides valuable insights for designers and even marketing professionals. These guidelines establish technical criteria to make web content more accessible for people with various disabilities, such as visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor impairments.  

The WCAG defines three levels of compliance ‚Äî **A, AA, and AAA** ‚Äî representing varying degrees of accessibility. While I won‚Äôt go into technical details about these levels today, they‚Äôll appear in future posts.

The WCAG outlines **four core principles** that must be followed to ensure web content can be perceived, operated, understood, and robustly interpreted by all users:  

1. **Perceivability**:  
   Ensure that content can be perceived by all users, regardless of their sensory abilities. Perceivable content ensures that all users can have a similar experience. For example, all non-text content should include a text alternative to describe the content, such as adding an image description in the tag.  

2. **Operability**:  
   Ensure users can interact with the content regardless of their motor or cognitive abilities. Operable content ensures that all controls and interactive elements are usable. For instance, navigation via keyboard is crucial, meaning users should be able to navigate all elements without keyboard barriers.  

3. **Understandability**:  
   Ensure content is clear and comprehensible for all users, regardless of literacy levels or native language. Understandable content avoids confusion and ambiguity. If technical terms or jargon are used, a glossary or explanation should be provided.  

4. **Robustness**:  
   Ensure content displays correctly across different browsers and assistive technologies. Robust web content is accessible with a wide variety of technologies and adapts as technologies advance.

Applying these principles may involve steps such as providing text alternatives for images, adding captions to videos, ensuring adequate contrast between text and background, and more. I know this might seem abstract at first, but as you dive deeper into the topic, it becomes easier to understand how to put these principles into practice.  

Accessibility is not just a technical requirement; it‚Äôs a commitment to creating a more inclusive digital world.
