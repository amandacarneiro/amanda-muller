# **Letter to Amelie**

I don’t know what you’ll become when you grow up, but I do know I want to teach you to look at the world with endless curiosity. I don’t know who you’ll love, but I know I want to teach you to seek a love that is respectful, caring, and always walks by your side, helping you grow. That love will eventually become your best friend, just as your dad is mine. I don’t know what you’ll choose to study, but I want to teach you to value and pay attention to the things you learn. I don’t know how many languages you’ll speak, but I do know I want to teach you to adapt and achieve your goals wherever you are.

There’s no magic formula for raising children. I’ve heard a lot of people say that. But I know what I want to do: listen to you, be present, be a comfort for your tears, and a sword and shield for your battles. I don’t want to shelter you under my wings—I want to help you learn how to fly, and I want to do that with a lot of love and patience.

I know you’ll challenge me—that’s every daughter’s role with her mother—and I want to teach you to do that whenever you feel it’s necessary. I don’t expect or want you to be blindly obedient. I hope you’ll always care for your safety, follow the rules, be aware of your limits, and, most importantly, respect the limits others set with you. But I never want or expect you to just be an obedient child. Obedience isn’t always a virtue. Respecting those who don’t respect us isn’t good. Letting others cross your boundaries out of politeness isn’t good. What I want to give you is a home where you can talk about what’s wrong without fear of judgment, a mom you can call for help without fear of retaliation. I want to give you affection, cuddles, and love simply because I love you—not as a reward for good behavior. I want you to feel my genuine interest in your tastes and preferences at every stage of your life. I’ll share my interests with you too, and I dream of the day you’ll want to read *Harry Potter* with me, watch *Star Wars*, or build a robot to automate a curtain at home that will turn out clunky and wonky, but we’ll have fun making it. Maybe you’ll like math more, maybe humanities—it doesn’t matter to me what you choose. What matters is that you dedicate yourself and trust in your ability to excel at whatever you decide to do.

It’s funny, you know? Just the other day, I was a 31-year-old pregnant teenager (so it felt), and now here I am, after giving birth, spending hours nursing you. I never thought I’d enjoy simply watching another human being exist as much as I do. I’m really watching you grow every day, and I realize I don’t know much about your growth, development, and evolution, but I’m working hard to learn everything I can to support you.

One thing I’m certain of: you’ll never lack a warm embrace or affection. You are the most precious thing in the world, and I love you as if you’ve always existed. May the adventure of life be fabulous for you, my little one!
